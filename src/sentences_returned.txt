At the age of four he could learn a piece of music in half an hour
At five he was playing the clavier incredibly well
At six he began composing writing his first symphonies at the age of eight
He was constantly traveling all over Europe with his father Leopold Mozart 1719 1787 a violinist minor composer and Vice Kapellmeister at the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg
The musical feats and tricks of young Wolfgang were exhibited to the courts beginning in Munich in 1762 to musical academicians and to the public
Between the ages of seven and fifteen the young Mozart spent half of his time on tour
During these tours Mozart heard absorbed and learned various European musical idioms eventually crystallizing his own mature style.
Fully expecting to find an ideal post outside his sleepy home town of Salzburg and the detested archiepiscopal court in 1777 Wolfgang went on a tour with his mother to Munich Mannheim and Paris
It was in Paris that his mother died suddenly in July 1778
With no prospects of a job Mozart dejectedly returned to Salzburg in 1779 and became court organist to the Archbishop
Mozart finally achieved an unceremonious dismissal from the archiepiscopal court in 1781 and thereafter became one of the first musicians in history to embark upon a free lance career without benefit of church court or a rich patron
Mozart moved to Vienna where he lived for a time with the Webers a family he had met in 1777
He eventually married Constanze Weber in August of1782 against the wishes and strict orders of his father
Then for a time things began to look bright for the young composer
Beginning in 1782 with the Singspiel Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail The Abduction from the Seraglio Mozart began turning out one masterpiece after another in every form and genre.
Mozart is probably the only composer in history to have written undisputed masterworks in virtually every musical genre of his age
His serenades divertimenti and dances written on request for the entertainment and outdoor parties of the nobility have become synonomous with the Classical age of elegance and are perhaps best exemplified by the well known Serenade in G major which the composer called Eine kleine Nachtmusik A little night music.
In Vienna Mozart became a regular at the court of Emperor Joseph II 1741 1790 where he wrote much of his greatest music
A sampling of Mozarts mature works comprise a virtual honor roll of musical masterpieces: the last ten string quartets the string quintets and the Quintet for clarinet and strings; the Mass in C minor and the unfinished Requiem; the Serenade for thirteen wind instruments the Clarinet concerto the late piano concertos and the last six symphonies
Mozarts more than twenty piano concertos remain models of the classic concerto form developed by him over time into works of symphonic breadth and scope
The concertos often begin with an elaborate sonata form first movement followed by a tender and melodious second movement and usually conclude with a brisk engaging rondo as in the Piano Concerto no
22 in E flat
In his last three symphonies the second of which is the great Symphony no
40 in G minor Mozart infused this form with a passion and expressiveness unheard of in symphonic writing until the advent of Beethoven.
Of Mozarts operas Le nozze di Figaro The Marriage of Figaro composed for the Viennese court in 1786 is the earliest opera still found in the repertoire of virtually all of todays opera houses
Through his dramatic and musical genius Mozart transformed such operatic comedies and characters into living breathing dramas peopled with real human beings
He found a kindred spirit in this regard at the Viennese court in the person of Lorenzo da Ponte 1749 1838 who supplied Mozart with the librettos of his three Italian operatic masterpieces
Figaro was followed in 1787 by Don Giovanni Don Juan written for Prague where Figaro had been an overwhelming success
The intensity of Mozarts music in the penultimate scene of Don Giovanni in which the title character is dragged down to hell unrepentant at the hands of an avenging spirit might even be said to have helped usher in the Romantic era
Having scaled the heights of Italian opera buffa Mozart turned again to the German Singspiel in the final year of his life
Again he produced yet another masterpiece this time with the unconventional combination of low comedy and high ideals
Die Zauberflote The Magic Flute tells of a young prince who successfully endures the trials put to him by a fraternal priesthood in a search for truth and love while the everyman character of Papageno in his song Der Vogelfanger bin ich ja yearns for the earthly pleasures of wine food and female companionship.
During his years in Vienna Mozart also made the acquaintance of composer Franz Joseph Haydn
The two became close friends and the older composers music had a profound influence on Mozart
Between 1782 and 1785 Mozart composed a series of six string quartets which he dedicated to Haydn
Upon playing through some of them together Haydn said to Mozarts father who was present Before God and as an honest man your son is the greatest composer I know either personally or by name.
Yet through his mismanagement of money and as a successful composer of operas and a reknowned piano virtuoso he made a great deal and the documented incidences of his tactless impulsive and at times childish behavior in an era of powdered wigs and courtly manners Mozart seemed to find it difficult to make a successful living
By 1790 he was writing letters to friends describing himself and his family he and Constanze had six children only two of which survived in desperate circumstances and begging for money
He was also by this time seriously ill and had been intermittently for some time with what was most likely disease of the kidneys
With the success of The Magic Flute and a newly granted yearly stipend Mozart was just beginning to become financially stable when his illness brought an end to his life and career at the age of thirty six
He was buried like most Viennese in those days by the decree of Emperor Joseph in a common grave the exact location of which remains unknown.
The influence of Mozart on the composers that followed cannot be emphasized too strongly
He was idolized by such late nineteenth century composers as Richard Wagner and Peter Tchaikovsky; and his music came to influence the neo classical compositions of Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev in the twentieth century.

This article discusses the nationality of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 17561791.
The two main labels that have been used to describe Mozarts nationality are Austrian and German
However in Mozarts own time these terms were used differently from the way they are used today because the modern nation states of Austria and Germany did not yet exist
Any decision to label Mozart as Austrian or German or neither involves political boundaries history language culture and Mozarts own views
Editors of modern encyclopedias and other reference sources differ in how they assign a label to Mozart if any in light of conflicting criteria.


Mozart was born in Salzburg the capital of a small essentially sovereign state called the Archbishopric of Salzburg
Thus in one sense Mozarts nationality could be said to be Salzburgian though English language biographers do not generally use this term to designate his nationality.
The Archbishopric of Salzburg was but one of more than 300 similarly independent states in the part of Europe that was populated by German speakers
Most of these states Salzburg included were included in a larger political entity the Holy Roman Empire
The Holy Roman Empire was German in various ways: most of its population was German speaking its official full name was the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation German: Heiliges Romisches Reich Deutscher Nation it conducted most of its business in German and one of the titles held by its emperor was King in Germany
Beales adds [the emperor] and the Empire were foci of German patriotism
Even in Hamburg Protestant and remote from his court [in Vienna] prayers were regularly said for him and his birthday was celebrated.
However although the Holy Roman Empire was largely German it was hardly a nation state but only a very loose confederation the feeble residue of an empire that had been robust centuries earlier
According to the Encyclopdia Britannica the princes whose states comprised the empire legislated at will levied taxes concluded alliances and waged wars against each other ..
The imperial Diet meeting in Regensburg had degenerated into a debating society without authority or influence
The splendid [imperial] coronation ceremony in Frankfurt am Main could not disguise the fact that the office conferred on its holder little more than prestige.
Thus although the phrase Mozart was German can be given a cultural interpretation see below it cannot be taken to mean that Mozart was a citizen of Germany
During his time there was no German nation state that he could have been a citizen of.
According to Beales 2006a 3031 in Mozarts time the word Austria German: Osterreich had several meanings.
The original Austria was the Archduchy of Austria a rather small state centered around Vienna roughly coextensive with the modern Austrian states of Upper Austria and Lower Austria
Starting in 1282 this core area was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty
Over the centuries the Habsburgs accreted ever more lands to their holdings both inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire and both German and non German speaking
Despite this expansion the Habsburg dynasty retained an Austrian identity maintaining their capital in Vienna and referring to their aggregated lands as the Austrian Monarchy
The word Austria was sometimes used as an informal cover term for all of the lands ruled by the Habsburgs
The power of the Habsburgs was such that they came to dominate the emperorship of the Holy Roman Empire: starting in 1452 the Electors the handful of princes who held the right to elect the next emperor virtually always chose the Habsburg monarch for the emperorship whenever the office became vacant
The emperors who served in Mozarts time were Francis I Joseph II and Leopold II
Of these the latter two were Habsburg descendants; Francis I was the husband of the Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa who held the emperorship on her behalf since as a woman she could not legally serve.
