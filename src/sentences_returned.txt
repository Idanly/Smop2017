The Mediterranean Sea is a body of water that is almost completely surrounded by land
It lies between three continents: Europe to the north Asia to the east and Africa to the south
Africa
It stretches over 2500 miles 4000 km from Gibraltar to Israel
The Mediterranean is connected to the Atlantic through a 14 km wide strait where Europe and Africa meet
The Suez Canal links it to the Red Sea and the Bosporus to the Black Sea
The Mediterranean Sea covers an area of over 2.5 million square kilometers 950 000 square miles
It is divided into different parts by islands and peninsulas
The Aegean is the sea between Greece and Turkey the Adriatic Sea lies between Italy and the Balkan Peninsula and the Tyrrhenian Sea is between Italy and its western islands
The coastline of the Mediterranean is made up of many bays and inlets
Three large peninsulas the Iberian the Italian and the Balkans reach out into the Mediterranean Sea
Among the largest islands in the Mediterranean are Sicily Corsica Sardinia and Crete .
The Mediterranean region is often called the cradle of civilization because many early cultures and civilizations developed along its shores.

The Mediterranean Sea was formed through movements of the Earths plates
When the ancient landmass of Pangaea broke apart about 250 million years ago a huge ocean the Tethys evolved around its middle
This ocean extended to the north of todays Alps and to the east as far as the Ural Mountains
When Africa and Europe started moving towards each other this ocean became smaller
The Mediterranean Sea is what is left of this large ancient ocean.
Geologists think that the Mediterranean dried up several times in the last few million years because the Strait of Gibraltar closed and reopened allowing water from the Atlantic to flow in.
Today the whole Mediterranean region is still very active
Earthquakes hit the Balkans Italy and Turkey regularly
The regions volcanoes for example Mt
Etna and Stromboli are among the most active in Europe
Mount Vesuvius became known for its famous eruption in 79 A
D
which wiped out the Roman town of Pompeii.

The Mediterranean region has a special climate that can be found in other parts of the world like South Africa or southeastern Australia
The summers are very hot and dry with almost no rain at all while winters are mild and rainy.

The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1 500 meters or over 5000 feet
The Po Nile Rhone and Ebro are the largest rivers that flow into the sea
They all create deltas because there are no currents that carry the water away
Tides are not as strong as they are in the Atlantic Ocean
The difference between high and low tide is only about 0.5 meters.
Because of its hot climate much water evaporates and the sea has a higher concentration of salt than other oceans especially in the eastern part where the water temperature is also higher.



The Mediterranean attracts millions of tourists every year
About one third of global tourism takes place here
Spain Italy Greece and Turkey rely on tourism for a large part of their yearly income.
Although it is very dry during the summer months farming plays an important role in the region
Olives oranges and grapes are grown
The Mediterranean is the worlds most important wine growing region
Apart from that farmers grow other crops especially wheat and barley
A small part of the coastal population earns their money by fishing.
Recently natural gas and oil have been discovered in the Aegean Sea causing a conflict between Greece and Turkey.

Ancient cultures in Greece Egypt and Rome and Phoenicia developed along the shores of the Mediterranean region
The people of these civilizations not only traded with others but sailed over the calm seas to enlarge their territories through warfare.
For hundreds of years the Mediterranean Sea was the main water route
Muslims controlled a large part of the Mediterranean throughout the early part of the Middle Ages
Some centuries later Venice and Florence became the worlds main trading centers
However when Vasco da Gama sailed around Africa during the Age of Exploration the trade route across the Mediterranean to Asia became less important
This changed when the Suez Canal opened in 1869
The Europeans had a new trade route through the Red Sea to their colonies Asia.

Environmental problems are a big challenge to the future of the Mediterranean region.
Climate change and global warming could raise the sea level of the Mediterranean as much as 60 cm and thus flood parts of the Nile Delta or the city of Venice.
Pollution has become widespread along the coasts of the Mediterranean as tourism dumps thousands of tons of sewage into the sea each year.
Although many coastal areas and small islands of the Mediterranean depend on tourism as a main source of income it has also driven animal life away from the shores
Sea turtles are in danger of becoming extinct because tourists take away their nesting places.
The Mediterranean is one of the worlds busiest shipping routes
Oil is carried through tankers from the Middle East to ports in Italy and France
Leaky tankers and washing containers at sea contribute to water pollution of the Mediterranean
Some ships carry heavy metals and other poisonous material.
Overfishing has also become a problem in the Mediterranean region
Over 60% of all fish species are in danger of dying out.
Recently the countries surrounding the Mediterranean region have been moving closer together in an attempt to protect the region.





The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant
The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.
The name Mediterranean is derived from the Latin mediterraneus meaning inland or in the middle of land from medius middle and terra land
It covers an approximate area of 2.5 million km2 965000 sq mi but its connection to the Atlantic the Strait of Gibraltar is only 14 km 8.7 mi wide
The Strait of Gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Gibraltar and Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa
In oceanography it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere.
The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1500 m 4900 ft and the deepest recorded point is 5267 m 17280 ft in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea
The sea is bordered on the north by Europe the east by Asia and in the south by Africa
It is located between latitudes 30 and 46 N and longitudes 6 W and 36 E
Its west east length from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun on the southwestern coast of Turkey is approximately 4000 km 2500 miles
The seas average north south length from Croatias southern shore to Libya is approximately 800 km 500 miles
The Mediterranean Sea including the Sea of Marmara connected by the Dardanelles to the Aegean Sea has a surface area of approximately 2510000 square km 970000 square miles.
The sea was an important route for merchants and travelers of ancient times that allowed for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region
The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies.
The countries with coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea are Albania Algeria Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia Cyprus Egypt France Greece Israel Italy Lebanon Libya Malta Morocco Monaco Montenegro Slovenia Spain Syria Tunisia and Turkey
In addition the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea.


The term Mediterranean derives from the Latin word mediterraneus meaning amid the earth note: earth in the sense soil not Planet Earth or between land medi ; adj
medius um a middle between + terra f
land earth: as it is between the continents of Africa Asia and Europe
The Ancient Greek name Mesogeios  is similarly from  between +  land earth
It can be compared with the Ancient Greek name Mesopotamia  meaning between rivers.
The Mediterranean Sea has historically had several names
For example the Carthaginians called it the Syrian Sea and latter Romans commonly called it Mare Nostrum Latin Our Sea and occasionally Mare Internum Sallust The Jugurthine War 17.
In ancient Syrian texts Phoenician epics and in the Hebrew Bible it was primarily known as the Great Sea   HaYam HaGadol Numbers 34:67; Joshua 1:4 9:1 15:47; Ezekiel 47:101520 or simply The Sea 1 Kings 5:9; comp
1 Macc
14:34 15:11; however it has also been called the Hinder Sea   due to its location on the west coast of Greater Syria or the Holy Land and therefore behind a person facing the east sometimes translated as Western Sea Deut
11:24; Joel 2:20
Another name was the Sea of the Philistines   Exod
23:31 from the people inhabiting a large portion of its shores near the Israelites
The sea is also called the Great Sea Middle English: Grete See in the General Prologue by Geoffrey Chaucer
In Ottoman Turkish it has also been called Bahr i Sefid meaning the Pure White Sea.
In Modern Hebrew it has been called HaYam HaTikhon   the Middle Sea reflecting the Seas name in ancient Greek Mesogeios Latin Mare internum and modern languages in both Europe and the Middle East Mediterranean etc..
Similarly in Modern Arabic it is known as al Bahr [al Abyad] al Mutawassit  []  the [White] Middle Sea while in Islamic and older Arabic literature it was referenced as Bahr al Rum   or the Romaic/Byzantine Sea.
In Turkish it is known as Akdeniz the White Sea since among Turks the white colour ak represents the west.
Several ancient civilisations were located around the Mediterranean shores and were greatly influenced by their proximity to the sea
It provided routes for trade colonisation and war as well as food from fishing and the gathering of other seafood for numerous communities throughout the ages.
Due to the shared climate geology and access to the sea cultures centered on the Mediterranean tended to have some extent of intertwined culture and history.
Two of the most notable Mediterranean civilisations in classical antiquity were the Greek city states and the Phoenicians both of which extensively colonised the coastlines of the Mediterranean
Later when Augustus founded the Roman Empire the Romans referred to the Mediterranean as Mare Nostrum Our Sea.
Darius I of Persia who conquered Ancient Egypt built a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea
