The Statue of Liberty Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberte eclairant le monde is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City in the United States
The copper statue a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States was designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel
The statue was dedicated on October 28 1886.
The Statue of Liberty is a robed female figure representing Libertas the Roman goddess
She holds a torch above her head and in her left arm carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with JULY IV MDCCLXXVI July 4 1776 the date of the U
S
Declaration of Independence
A broken chain lies at her feet
The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad.
Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician Edouard Rene de Laboulaye who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U
S
independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U
S
peoples
Due to the post war instability in France work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s
In 1875 Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U
S
would provide the site and build the pedestal
Bartholdi completed the head and the torch bearing arm before the statue was fully designed and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.
The torch bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882
Fundraising proved difficult especially for the Americans and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds
Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120000 contributors most of whom gave less than a dollar
The statue was constructed in France shipped overseas in crates and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloes Island
The statues completion was marked by New Yorks first ticker tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.
The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service
Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916.


According to the National Park Service the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by Edouard Rene de Laboulaye the president of the French Anti Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time
The project is traced to a mid 1865 conversation between Edouard Rene de Laboulaye a staunch abolitionist and Frederic Bartholdi a sculptor
In after dinner conversation at his home near Versailles Laboulaye an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War is supposed to have said: If a monument should rise in the United States as a memorial to their independence I should think it only natural if it were built by united efforta common work of both our nations
The National Park Service in a 2000 report however deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870
In another essay on their website the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences With the abolition of slavery and the Unions victory in the Civil War in 1865 Laboulayes wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States
In order to honor these achievements Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France
Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy.
According to sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi who later recounted the story Laboulayes comment was not intended as a proposal but it inspired Bartholdi
Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye
Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s he approached Ismail Pasha Khedive of Egypt a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant robed and holding a torch aloft at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said
Sketches and models were made of the proposed work though it was never erected
There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal the Colossus of Rhodes: an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun Helios
This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet 30 m high and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships.
Any large project was further delayed by the Franco Prussian War in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia
In the war Napoleon III was captured and deposed
Bartholdis home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians and a more liberal republic was installed in France
As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans
In June 1871 Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.
Arriving at New York Harbor Bartholdi focused on Bedloes Island now named Liberty Island as a site for the statue struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it
He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States governmentit had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense
It was thus as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye: land common to all the states
As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S
Grant who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue
Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail and met many Americans who he thought would be sympathetic to the project
But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign.
Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870
The son of a friend of Bartholdis American artist John LaFarge later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U
S
visit at La Farges Rhode Island studio
Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France
He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians
One of these was the Lion of Belfort a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months
The defiant lion 73 feet 22 m long and half that in height displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty.
Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty
In early American history two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation
One of these symbols the personified Columbia was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France
Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans
The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty derived from Libertas the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome especially among emancipated slaves
A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art including Thomas Crawfords Statue of Freedom 1863 atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.
Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol
A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France
However Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eugene Delacroixs famed Liberty Leading the People 1830
In this painting which commemorates Frances Revolution of 1830 a half clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen
Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution and so Bartholdis figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes
Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch representing progress for the figure to hold.
Crawfords statue was designed in the early 1850s
It was originally to be crowned with a pileus the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome
Secretary of War Jefferson Davis a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol
He ordered that it be changed to a helmet
Delacroixs figure wears a pileus and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well
Instead he used a diadem or crown to top its head
In so doing he avoided a reference to Marianne who invariably wears a pileus
The seven rays form a halo or aureole
They evoke the sun the seven seas and the seven continents and represent another means besides the torch whereby Liberty enlightens the world.
Bartholdis early models were all similar in concept: a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty wearing a stola and pella gown and cloak common in depictions of Roman goddesses and holding a torch aloft
According to popular accounts the face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi the sculptors mother but Regis Huber the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this as well as other similar speculations have no basis in fact
He designed the figure with a strong uncomplicated silhouette which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan
He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose
Bartholdi wrote of his technique:
The surfaces should be broad and simple defined by a bold and clear design accentuated in the important places
The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared
By exaggerating the forms in order to render them more clearly visible or by enriching them with details we would destroy the proportion of the work
Finally the model like the design should have a summarized character such as one would give to a rapid sketch
Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study and that the artist concentrating his knowledge should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.
